    This class extracts all the RR interval data that is present for a person on a specific day.
    Calculates the necessary features from the rr interval data and assigns each minute of the day as 
    Stress/Not stress state.
    
    ..algorithm:
        Input:
            RR interval datastream. 
            Each datapoint contains the following three things
                1. A list of RR-interval array. Each entry in the list corresponds to a realization 
                of the position of R peaks in that minute
                2. Standard Deviation of Heart Rate within the minute
                3. A list corresponding to the heart rate values calculated from variable realizations 
                of the RR interval on a sliding window of window size = 8 second and window offset = 2 second.
        Steps:
            1. Extract all the RR interval data for a user on a specific day
            2. Extract all the 16 features per minute of the RR interval data
            3. Standardize each feature row and output stress/not stress state
        
        Output:
            A datastream containing a list of datapoints, each datapoint represents one minute where sample=0 
            means the user was not stressed and sample=1 means the person was stressed
