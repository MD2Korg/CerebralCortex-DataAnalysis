    This class extracts all the RR interval data that is present for a person on a specific day.
    Calculates the necessary features from the rr interval data and assigns each minute of the day as 
    Stress/Not stress state.
    
    Algorithm::

        Input:
            RR interval datastream. 
            Each DataPoint contains the following three things
                1. A list of RR-interval array. Each entry in the list corresponds to a realization 
                of the position of R peaks in that minute
                2. Standard Deviation of Heart Rate within the minute
                3. A list corresponding to the heart rate values calculated from variable realizations 
                of the RR interval on a sliding window of window size = 8 second and window offset = 2 second.

        Steps:
            1. Extract all the RR interval data for a user on a specific day
            2. Extract all the 16 features per minute of the RR interval data
            3. Standardize each feature row and output stress/not stress state
        
        Output:
            A datastream containing a list of datapoints, each DataPoint represents one minute where sample=0
            means the user was not stressed and sample=1 means the person was stressed

        List of Features:
            1. 82nd perentile
            2. 18th perentile
            3. mean
            4. median

            10. Energy in very high frequency range
            11. Energy in low frequency range
            12. Ration of low to high frequency energy 
            13. quartile deviation
            14. heart rate
