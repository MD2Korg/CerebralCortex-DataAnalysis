    """
    This class applies a pretrained Support Vector Machine model with radial basis kernel to one minute of 
    respiration cycle features 
    and produces a binary output of Stress/Not Stressed.
    
    The model was trained with python scikit-learn library with 21 participants data.
    The hyperparameters of the model are:
        1. C = 10.0
        2. Gamma = 0.01
    The model takes 14 input features as listed:
        1.  inspiration_duration
        2.  expiration_duration
        3.  respiration_duration
        4.  inspiration_expiration_duration_ratio
        5.  stretch
        6.  inspiration_velocity
        7.  expiration_velocity
        8.  skewness
        9.  kurtosis
        10.  entropy
        11.  inspiration_expiration_velocity_ratio
        12.  inspiration_expiration_area_ratio
        13.  expiration_respiration_duration_ratio
        14.  resspiration_area_inspiration_duration_ratio
    
    In every one minute of data there will be more than 1 respiration cycles each with these 14 features pre-calculated.
    We take the median of each of this feature found within the minute, 
    transform the (1,14) shape feature row according to a pre-trained standard 
    transformation and apply the Support Vector Machine model to get the binary output
    
    The model trained from respiration here has its theoretical underpinnings described in the following paper:
