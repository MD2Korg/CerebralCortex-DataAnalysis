Combines Respiration raw datastream with respiration baseline datastream and identifies the respiration 
cycles through identification of peak and valley DataPoints. Then for each respiration cycle a set of 21
features are calculated.
      
Algorithm::

    Input:
        1. Respiration Raw datastream
        2. Respiration baseline datastream

    Steps:
        1. Combine the respiration raw with respiration baseline datastream on a DataPoint by DataPoint basis
        2. Filter the combined respiration raw and baseline datastream to get rid of the signal at 
        times when the person was not wearing the sensor suite
        3. Identify the Respiration Cycles by getting the peak and valley points
        4. Compute the features

    Output:
        A list of DataPoints with each DataPoint representing a respiration cycle and containing 21 different features
        calculated from it.
        The features are:
            1.  inspiration_duration
            2.  expiration_duration
            3.  respiration_duration
            4.  inspiration_expiration_duration_ratio
            5.  stretch
            6.  inspiration_velocity
            7.  expiration_velocity
            8.  skewness
            9.  kurtosis
            10.  entropy
            11.  inspiration_expiration_velocity_ratio
            12.  inspiration_expiration_area_ratio
            13.  expiration_respiration_duration_ratio
            14.  respiration_area_inspiration_duration_ratio
            15.  power_.05-.2_Hz
            16.  power_.201-.4_Hz
            17.  power_.401-.6_Hz
            18.  power_.601-.8_Hz
            19.  power_.801-1_Hz
            20.  correlation_previous_cycle
            21.  correlation_next_cycle
