Expected conservative time is the half_hourly time of average staying time. For example if average staying time is 8 hour 20 minute then expected conservative time is 8 hour 30 minute on the other hand if average arrival time is 8 hour 37 minute then expected conservative time is 9 hour. The staying time which are less than expected conservative time are labeled less_than_expected_conservative_time and the staying time which are more than expected conservative time are labeled as more_than_expected_conservative_time, the staying time which are exactly same as the expected conservative time are labeled as in_expected_conservative_time."
